HOW IT WORKS

git.thomaslevine.com is a super light-weight place for Tom to host git repositories.

Git repositories are located at `/home/$permissions/*/.git`, where the main
two values for `permissions` are `public` and `private`. For example, these could be
git repositories.

    /home/public/pickle-warehouse/.git
    /home/private/taxes-2013/.git

These repositories are non-bare repositories for convenience, but they should be used
like bare repositories; don't develop on git.thomaslevine.com.

Each of these permissions groups corresponds to a user account with read-only access
to its own home directory. The public account has no password, so anyone can do this.

    git clone public@git.thomaslevine.com:pickle-warehouse/.git

You can, of course, configure different authentication methods for the non-public users.

They also get served over HTTP at addresses like this.

    git.thomaslevine.com/public/pickle-warehouse

That address would be open to everyone, but you can configure different permissions in
nginx for other directories.

CONFIGURATION

Install the NetBSD 6.1.3 AMI, and then run `./install`.
