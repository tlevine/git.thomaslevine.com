This package contains documentation and configuration files for git.thomaslevine.com

HOW IT WORKS

git.thomaslevine.com is a super light-weight place for Tom to host git repositories.

Git repositories are located at `/home/$permissions/*/.git`. You can have any permissions
you want. Tom has `public` for things that everyone can see, and he might make other groups
if he wants to give access to just a few people. Thus, these could be git repositories.

    /home/public/pickle-warehouse/.git
    /home/accountant/taxes-2013/.git

There is one special permissions group called `personal`. It is special in that it is
not a user account, so there's no way to log in as it; it is for things that only Tom should see.

    /home/personal/location-of-buried-treasure/.git

These repositories are non-bare repositories for convenience, but they should be used
like bare repositories; don't develop on git.thomaslevine.com.

Each of these permissions groups corresponds to a user account with read-only access
to its own home directory. The public account has no password, so anyone can do this.

    git clone public@git.thomaslevine.com:pickle-warehouse/.git

You can, of course, configure different authentication methods for the non-public users.

They also get served over HTTP at addresses like this.

    git.thomaslevine.com/public/pickle-warehouse

That address would be open to everyone, but you can configure different permissions in
nginx for other directories.

Recall that none of these permissions-group user accounts has write access; to write
to the repositories, you should use the `author` user account, whose home directory is
`/home`.

    git push author@git.thomaslevine.com/public/pickle-warehouse/.git

CONFIGURATION

Install the NetBSD 6.1.3 AMI, and then run `./install`.
This will install dependences and run basic configurations.

It also provides a helper script for setting permissions.
This script is stored in /usr/bin/git-permissions.
When you run this, configurations from /home/.git-permissions
will be applied.

The .git-permissions file is quite simple; it should look like this.

    public= # no password
    accountant=h,c2buon2

COLLABORATION: SYNCING WITH OTHER GIT REPOSITORIES

When Tom is collaborating with you, you are likely to clone Tom's repositories and
vice-versa. Then you're going to want to merge each other's changes.
git.thomaslevine.com gives write access to only one user, so Tom is not going to
let you write directly to it; instead, you should serve your git repository somewhere,
and he'll fetch it.
