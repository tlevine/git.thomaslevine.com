This package contains documentation and configuration files for git.thomaslevine.com

HOW IT WORKS

git.thomaslevine.com is a super light-weight place for Tom to host git repositories.

Git repositories are located at `/home/*/.git`. Thus, these could be git repositories.

    /home/pickle-warehouse/.git

There are two user accounts that we care about: tlevine and _. The present package
doesn't configure SSH login for either user, but the following settings should be
specified.

* SSH key only for tlevine
* no authentication for _

Thus, anyone can do this.

    git clone _@git.thomaslevine.com:pickle-warehouse/.git
    # Note: this is the one part that doesn't work yet.

And only Tom can do this.

    git push tlevine@git.thomaslevine.com:pickle-warehouse/.git master

There is a post-receive hook that checks out the HEAD of master,
so a checkout of the "master" branch gets served over HTTP at addresses like this.

    git.thomaslevine.com/pickle-warehouse

CONFIGURATION

Install the NetBSD 6.1.3 AMI, and then run `./install`.
This will install dependences and run basic configurations.

This command is helpful for debugging nginx configurations. 

    /etc/rc.d/nginx restart && curl localhost || tail -n1 /var/log/nginx/error.log

COLLABORATION: SYNCING WITH OTHER GIT REPOSITORIES

When Tom is collaborating with you, you are likely to clone Tom's repositories and
vice-versa. Then you're going to want to merge each other's changes.
git.thomaslevine.com gives write access to only one user, so Tom is not going to
let you write directly to his repository; instead, you should serve your git repository
somewhere, and he'll fetch it.
